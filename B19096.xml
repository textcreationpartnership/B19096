            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hereas We have been certainly informed, that diverse persons, who either are actually Souldiers of Our Army, or pretend themselves to be so, do wander up and down from Parish to Parish, in severall Counties of this Our Kingdom under Our obedience, and there Quarter themselves upon the Inhabitants, and enforce them to give them Free-Quarter, without making any sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; and likewise very often Robbe and despoyle them of their Horses; Cattell, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther goods, to the great prejudice and discouragement of Our good Subjects in those Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. For prevention whereof, and that We may not be wanting, in these times of distraction and Rebellion, to give Our good Subjects all the reliefe and Protection We can possible, We are gratiously pleased to declare Our Pleasure, and hereby to Will and Command, all and every Constable or other Officer of any Parish or Towne, whereunto any persons shall come, pretending themselves to be Souldiers, strictly to examine them, and if he either find they have Robbed, or taken away any Horses, Cattell, or other goods from any Our Subjects whatsoever, without authority, or that they cannot produce any authentique passe, under the Hand and Seale of the Colonell, Lieutenant, Colonell, or Sergeant-Major of the Regiment whereof he or they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend themselves, or other the superior-Officers of Our Army, then the said Constable or other Officer, is forthwith to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend them, and cause them to be safely brought and delivered to the chiefe Officers of any Our neerest Garrisons or Quarters, who are speedily to cause them to be sent and delivered to the Provost Marshall-Generall of Our Army, or to such other Provost-Marshall, whom We shall for the ease and safety of each County cause to reside therein, who recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with them particulars of the Offences of such Offenders, shall cause them to be brought to a Court of Warre, there to receive punishment as they deserve, for the satisfaction, and future security of Our good Subjects. And if it shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen that such straglers shall be of so great force and number, that the Constables shall not dare to apprehend them, then Our Command is, that upon notice given to the chiefe Officer of Our next Garrison or Quarter, he give the Constable, or other Officer such assistance, by sending out such a party, as shall be requisite to performe the same. But if any Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Our Army (especially those who are sick or wounded) shall passe through any of Our Counties, having such Passe or Testimoniall, then Our Command is, that the Constable of every Parish, where they come to Lodge, shall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them necessary dyet, and Lodging, the charge whereof shall be allowed out of the Contribution, in all those Counties who pay us the same. This Our Pleasure, We Command shall instantly be published in all the severall Pari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shes of the Counties in Our Obedience, and be therein duly and fully observed by all Persons whatsoever, whom it may in any sort concerne, at their utmost perills.</p>
